Authority Legitimacy in Agent-Executed Actions

A recurring governance gap in autonomous and agent-based systems


Overview

As software systems evolve from passive tools into autonomous or semi-autonomous agents, a critical question has re-emerged across technical, legal, and governance contexts:

By what authority was this action taken — and was that authority legitimate at the moment the action occurred?

Many agent systems validate access (identity, tokens, permissions) but do not explicitly validate authority legitimacy at time-of-action, particularly when actions are executed through plugins, skills, tools, or chained workflows.

This document isolates that gap.


The Failure Pattern

A recurring pattern is now observable across agent and plugin ecosystems:

Delegated autonomous actions proceed under implicit or inherited authority rather than explicit, current, bounded authority.

This occurs when an agent:
- executes tools based on prior consent,
- inherits permissions across sessions,
- composes multiple capabilities into higher-impact actions,
- or expands behaviour through updates,

without re-establishing that authority remains valid for the specific action being taken.

The result may be technically permitted action that is governance-illegitimate in retrospect.


Common Manifestations

This pattern appears as:
- inherited permission drift,
- capability escalation by composition,
- unreviewed skill or tool updates,
- high-impact actions without authority refresh,
- assumptions that permission persists unless explicitly revoked.

These are systemic conditions, not implementation bugs.


The Minimum Authority Question Set

Before an agent-executed action proceeds, a system should be able to answer — explicitly:

1. What authority is being exercised by this action?
2. Who (human or system) delegated that authority?
3. What constraints bound it (scope, time, capability)?
4. Is that authority still valid at this moment?
5. Is the action reversible or consequential?

If these cannot be answered, the action is operating under implicit authority.


Scope and Boundaries

This reference:
- does not propose implementations,
- does not recommend tools or controls,
- does not assess compliance or correctness.

It exists solely to make authority legitimacy in agent-executed actions recognisable, nameable, and discussable.


Context

This document represents a domain-specific slice of the broader parent doctrine Legible Authority for Autonomous Action (LAAA), which addresses authority legitimacy across autonomous systems more generally.


This document is a neutral, descriptive reference intended to support shared recognition of a recurring governance failure mode.
